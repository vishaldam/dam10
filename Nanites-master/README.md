User Stories
============
* I want a circle with constant velocity that bounces off the edges of the playfield
* I want a Spawner unit that produces a new spawner unit adjacent to it every 5 seconds. If there is no room, the spawner does nothing. This unit does not move.
* I want a Fighter unit that moves towards the closest enemy unit. When a Fighter touches an enemy spawner then the spawner dies. When a fighter touches an enemy fighter they both die.
* I want to be able to tell a spawner to spawn either Spawners or Fighters.
* Level 1 - The human player starts with a spawner near the top left of the playfield and the computer player starts with one in the bottom right. The human player wins when they have eliminated all enemy units.
